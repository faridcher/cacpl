# Intro

We have used the hidden Markov chain to estimate the probability of the animal being in each state. Hidden Markov chain is also helpful when we include covariates. Incorporating covariates, if there is any correlation with the movement metrics (step-length and turn-angle), improves the model fitting and behavioral estimation; it also provides us with the transitional probability matrices per covariate.

# Movement metrics

In the top row of the following figure, time series of step-length and turn-angle are shown. The step-length are in km and they have been divided by *8h*, the time-interval of GPS observations, this the step-lengths also exhibit *speed* time series. In the bottom row, histograms are being shown; they follow their natural distribution and the step-length could be fitted a Gamma and the turn-angle could be fitted a Von-Mises distribution. 

# Model fitting

Wind direction is the only circular covariate in the list of our covariates. Circular statistics generally don't have magnitude, i.e. wind direction of 350 degree, is not much different from wind direction of 10 degree. In order to introduce magnitude to wind direction, we have used cosine of wind direction instead. Cosine or Sine, take the periodicity of the statistics into account and therefore `cos(350)` is very close to `cos(10)`. However the cosine of 90 degree is not different from cosine 270, thus we have also computed the sine of the wind direction and added it as covariate.

Wind direction is reported by meteorological organizations by the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Wind direction is usually reported in cardinal directions or in azimuth degrees. For example, a wind coming from the south is given as 180 degrees; one from the east is 90 degrees.

For other covariates we have included only the covariate itself and avoided to compute additional covariates such as second order polynomials or logarithm. The reason is that the fitting of HMM models doesn't converge when we include these additional covariates. 

## Initial parameters

The choice of initial values is very critical for the HMM model to converge; it is important that the initial values to be as close as possible to their actual (estimated) values. There are many density functions that could characterize the distribution of movement metrics including gamma, weibell, exponential and chi-square for step-length and von-mises and wrapped-cauchy for the turn-angle distribution. gamma is the most general distribution and other distribution such as exponential or chi-square are the special cases for gamma. von-mises is the circular version of normal distribution and perfectly characterizes the turn-angle distribution. In the best case scenario of 2 states model, where movement metrics exhibit huge contrast, the per state densities are shown in the following illustration. In this graph, state 1 is the resting mode also known as range-resident mode and the state 2 is the moving mode (transient mode). In the resting mode the animal has shorter step-lengths which are accumulated near zero and turn-angles have roughly uniform distribution and their mean is zero. In the moving mode, the animal has larger step-lengths and thus gamma density has a larger mean and the density is skewed to the right to accommodate larger step-lengths; turn-angles have mean zero and a large concentration (small variance) that shows the directional movement in this mode.

In the rest of this document, state 1 and resting state, state 2 and moving state are used interchangeably.

### Step-length

The mean-variance parameterization is being used for gamma instead of more common shape-rate parameterization as it is more intuitive to reason about and relate to the step-length. A good practice to choose the initial mean and variance for the gamma distribution is to plot the step-length histogram and then overlay the density of gamma distribution using various mean and variance values to make it as close as possible to the gamma density shown in the above image. With the case of cheetah step-length, after a few trial and error, I found the following values as the best initial values for step-length gamma distribution:

: Initial values chosen for gamma distribution of cheetah step-length

|           | Mean   | Standard deviation |
| :-------: | :----: | :--------:         |
| State 1   | 0.1    | 0.1                |
| State 2   | 0.5    | 0.3                |

```{r 'initvalue', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.cap="Superimposition of gamma density function on step-length histogram with various mean and standard deviation values to choose initial values"}
# invisible(futils::par_fav())
# load ch1 windspeed hmm model
load('main.rda')
source('helpers.r')
hist(
  ch1_hmm_windspeed$data$step,
  freq = F,
  col = "gray",
  xlab = 'Step-length (Km)',
  xlim = c(0, 12),
  #ylim= c(0,1),
  main = "")

curve(moveHMM:::dgamma_rcpp(x,.1,.1),0,20,col=1,add=T,lwd=2) #state 1
curve(moveHMM:::dgamma_rcpp(x,.5,.3),0,20,col=2,add=T,lwd=2) #state 2
legend("topright",legend=c("State 1","State 2"),lwd=2,col=1:2)
```

It is also better to introduce variation to the initial values. Due to the numerical instability, in the model selection procedure, one fixed initial value may not work and the model fitting won't converge. We have introduced random variation using normal distribution with a relatively small variance (0.1) to the initial values to overcome this situation.

```{r 'mu_sigma0', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mu0 <- c(rnorm(1,.1,sd=.1),rnorm(1,.5,sd = .1))    #initial mu of State 1, State 2
sigma0 <- c(rnorm(1,.1, sd=.1),rnorm(1,.3, sd=.1)) #initial sigma of State 1, State 2
```
If some steps are exactly equal to zero, then strictly positive distributions such as the gamma are inadequate. In such cases, zero-inflated distributions can be considered. A zero-inflated step length distribution simply assumes that there is a probability z of observing a 0 and a probability of (1−z) of observing a positive value distributed according to a standard positive distribution (e.g. a gamma). In that case the (state-dependent) values z will be estimated, with the remaining positive distribution, weighted by (1−z), specified as one of the available standard step length distributions [@patterson09; @langrock12]. We have excluded the zero-step length before model fitting and therefore set the *zero mass* equal to 0.

### Turn-angle

Model fitting convergence is not very much sensitive to the turn-angle initial values compared to step-length.
Turn-angle means are set to zero and kept fixed for both states and only concentration ($\kappa$) parameter of Von Mises is being estimated where the initial values are set to 1 for moving state and set to a value near zero (0.1) for resting state.

## Additional terms

We have computed additional terms to undertake a thorough model selection procedure. Individual covariates (12) along with their square root , logarithm, cosine of angle variables ("wind direction") and 2nd order polynomials are added as additional covariates. All possible interactions of the main effects are also used in the model fitting process. To avoid further complexity, we have assumed the relation is linear and additive. For example, we have models of this type:

$${\beta _0} + {\beta _1}\cos (wind\_direction) + {\beta _2}height + {\beta _3}heigh{t^2} + {\beta _5}temperature . elevation$$

: List of additional covariates computed from main effects

Main Effects|Square Root|Logarithm|Angle Cosine|Polynomials|Interaction|Sum
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
12|12|12|2|24|12|74

So we have 74 covariates that we have to build our model on. Definitely, the best automatic approach would be "best subset selection" that takes every possible combination of covariates and compares the models performance, i.e. using AIC values. However, for $n=74$, $2^n = 1.9 \times {10^{22}}$ models will be computed which is not reasonable. Instead we have opted for the "forward step wise selection" which will not find the best possible model, rather a parsimonious model close to the best model. forward step wise selection procedure reduces the number of models to be evaluated to about $n^2 = 5476$, which can be done using a modern computer in a fair amount of time.

## Forward step-wise selection

We have implemented the "forward step wise selection" to select the best set of covariates. The pseudo-code is as the following algorithm:

| Forward step wise selection (FSWS) algorithm [@james13]|
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Let $M_0$ denote the null model, which contains no   predictors.                                   |
| 2. For $k=0,...,p-1$:                                                                                 |
| i) Consider all $p-k$ models that augment   the predictors in $M_k$ with one additional predictor.    |
| ii) Choose the best among these $p-k$ models, and call it $M_{k+1}$.                                |
| Here best is defined as having highest likelihood (MLE) value.                                      |
| 3. Select a single best model from among $M_0,...,M_p AIC$.                                         |

## Result

The result of FSWS leads to a few models that outperform the null model. The best model, in terms of AIC values, is the model with `~wind_speed + city_dist` covariates. The `~1` is the null model without any covariate in the following table. The third column in this table is the agreement of the states estimated using Viterbi algorithm against the null model states estimation.

~wind_speed|981.41|0.97
~wind_speed+elevation+city_dist|981.79|0.92
~wind_speed+elevation|982.89|0.97

## Goodness of fit

Pseudo-residuals are suitable to check the goodness of fit for time series model like hidden Markov chain. The pseudo-residuals (PR) of the step-lengths and turn-angles could be computed from output of hidden Markov model. On the other hand, Jarque-bera test statistics, tests the null of normality for x (step-length and turn-angle). Running the test on the PR of the best model (`~wind_speed + city_dist`), shows that the PR of step-length violates the normality assumption (p-value = 0.03662) within 95% confidence interval and thus is not a good model. By choosing the next available model in terms of AIC and computing the Jarque-bera statistics, we see the step-length p-value (0.05093) is not significant within 95% confidence interval. So we choose this simple model with only wind speed covariate as our best model.

```{r jarque_bera2}
# jarque bera test for noramlity of step-length and turn-angle pseudo residuals
ch1_hmm_windspeed %>%
moveHMM::pseudoRes() %$%
  list(
    step = tseries::jarque.bera.test(stepRes[complete.cases(stepRes)]),
    angleRes = tseries::jarque.bera.test(angleRes[complete.cases(angleRes)])
  )
```

```{r 'plotpr', fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Time series, qq-plots, and autocorrelation functions of the pseudo-residuals of the 2-states model."}
moveHMM::plotPR(ch1_hmm_windspeed)
```

## Coeficient 95% Confidence Intervals

The 95% confidence interval of the coefficients shows that the effect of wind speed is only significant in the transitions from state 1 to state 2 or 1. The coefficients are estimated only for **1 > 2** and **2 > 1**. The coefficients for **1 > 1** could be computed from the coefficients of **1 > 2** and the coefficients for **2 > 2** could be computed from coefficients of **2 > 1**. They follow this simple formula:

$$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{{P_{1 > 1}} = 1 - {P_{1 > 2}}}&{,}&{{P_{2 > 2}} = 1 - {P_{2 > 1}}}
\end{array}$$

```{r plot_ci, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5, fig.cap="95% confidence interval of the coefficient estimes shows that only the `wind_speed` is significant when transitioning from state 1 to state 1 or 2"}
hmm_plot_CI(ch1_hmm_windspeed)
```

The wind speed only affects the probabilities from the resting state. Animals that are resting are more likely to stay resting when the wind is high, and likewise less likely to start moving when the wind is high. However it is interesting that there is no significant (or even suggestive) effect of wind speed on animals that are already moving. That may speak to the pre-eminence of their motivation to be moving (e.g. hunger, looking for food etc) despite conditions.

# Best model

The output of the model confirms that the initial parameters value have been selected wisely due to their closeness to the estimated values. The only regression coefficient for the transition probabilities that is robust and could be interpreted is the wind speed for transition from state 2 to state 1 or 2. The negative values implies that the probability of switching from moving to resting state decreases as wind speed increases. Likewise, the probability of staying in moving state (2) increases as the wind speed increases.

print(ch1_hmm_windspeed)
```

## Model plot
Histogram of step lengths with fitted distributions (top-left), histogram of turning angles with fitted distributions (top-right), transition probabilities as functions of wind_speed (bottom-left), and map of decoded track for the cheetah (bottom-right) are shown below:

## States plot

In the following illustration the estimated probability of being in each state is shown. The actual states (1,2) could be computed using two approaches:

1. Viterbi: Reconstructs the most probable states sequence, using the Viterbi algorithm [@zucchini09]. The result of Viterbi is shown in the top row of the following illustration.

2. Conditional statement: In this method, if the probability of being in state 1 is more than a threshold i.e. 0.5, then the animal is in state 1.
